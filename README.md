# DriveWorks

Managing Google drive files could be time consuming and error prone. 
Imagine how boring it was to delete all documents titled as 'Untitled document'
among thousands of files under hundreds of folders. DriveWorks is a workspace 
addon to make file or folder management easy. The addon supports operations like 
deletion, renaming, etc on files/folders with filters like name matching, file 
type matching etc.
